## Hi, you might want to check this [ERPNext Docker Debian](https://github.com/pipech/erpnext-docker-debian).
I believe it's more stable and dockerfile and readme file is better written.

#  Dockerfile for building Self-contained ERPNext Image on CentOs

This repository contain Dockerfile use to build Docker Images in Docker Hub [**pipech/erpnext**](https://hub.docker.com/r/pipech/erpnext/)

**You might or might not be able to run docker images using this repository** because it's heavily base on other repository like [frappe/bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench), [frappe/frappe](https://github.com/frappe/frappe) and [frappe/erpnext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext)

So I think it's best to run using image from Docker Hub [pipech/erpnext](https://hub.docker.com/r/pipech/erpnext/) there I already clone, install those repository into Docker Images

#### What Dockerfile does

Please see it for yourself [here](https://github.com/pipech/docker-centos-erpnext/blob/master/Dockerfile), it's self explanatory.
